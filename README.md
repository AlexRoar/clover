<img src="docs/assets/clever4-front-white.png" align="right" width="400px" alt="Clover Drone">

Clover is a [PX4](https://px4.io)- and [ROS](https://www.ros.org)-powered educational programmable drone kit consisting of an unassembled quadcopter, open source software and documentation. The kit includes Pixracer-compatible autopilot, Raspberry Pi 4 as companion computer, a camera for computer vision navigation as well as additional sensors and peripheral devices.

The main documentation is available at [https://clover.coex.tech](https://clover.coex.tech/).

## Features

### Prebuilt RPi image

...

### Common robotics software

ROS, OpenCV...

### QGroundControl Wi-Fi bridge

...

### Easy autonomous flights programming

Taking off, navigating and land is just:

```python
navigate(x=0, y=0, z=1, frame_id='body', auto_arm=True)  # takeoff and hover 1 m above the ground
```

```python
navigate(x=1, y=0, z=0, frame_id='body')  # fly forward 1 m
```

```
land()
```

See [programming documentation](https://clover.coex.tech) for further information.

### Optical flow positioning

RPi based optical flow....

### ArUco markers recognizing

...

### Easy work with peripheral devices

Preinstalled package for the [LED strip](https://clover.coex.tech/en/leds.html) allows high-level control (such as rainbow effect or color fade) as well as individual LED low-level control:

```python
set_effect(r=0, g=100, b=0)  # fill strip with green color
```

```python
set_effect(effect='fade', r=0, g=0, b=255)  # fade to blue color
```

```python
set_effect(effect='rainbow')  # show rainbow
```

Preinstalled [VL53L1X rangefinder driver](https://clover.coex.tech/en/laser.html) passes data to the flight controller automatically and allows the user to get its data:

```python
data = rospy.wait_for_message('rangefinder/range', Range)  # get data from the rangefinder
```

Preinstalled fast Python [GPIO library](https://clover.coex.tech/en/gpio.html).

```python
pi.write(11, 1)  # set signal of pin 11 to high
```

```python
level = pi.read(12)  # read the state of pin 12
```

### Simulator

Gazebo-based simulation.
